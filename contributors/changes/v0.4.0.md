This release open-sources many of the underlying components in
separate repositories under an Apache 2.0 license:

The `diskuv-ocaml` repository (what you are reading now) has also changed to
Apache 2.0 and will be kept as the umbrella repository that manages the other
code and Opam repositories.

Opam has been upgraded from 2.1.0 to 2.1.2.

The MSYS2 environment has switched from the base `MSYS` to `CLANG64`, which
means you can install C/C++ packages that are
[compatible with Visual Studio](https://www.msys2.org/docs/environments/) and
have no dependency on MSYS2. The more than 2000 C/C++ packages can be discovered with
[MSYS2 package search of the "clang64" repository](https://packages.msys2.org/package/?repo=clang64) and
installed with [`with-dkml pacman -S <name of package>`](https://www.msys2.org/docs/package-management/).
Just keep the `with-dkml pacman -S pkg1 pkg2 ...` command
in a build script so your C/C++ packages can be reproduced on other machines
or when Diskuv OCaml is upgraded.

The following core packages have been upgraded:

* dune.2.9.1 -> 2.9.3
* ptime.0.8.6-msvcsupport -> 0.8.6
* sha.1.15.1 -> 1.15.2
* fmt.0.8.10 -> 0.9.0
* jingoo.1.4.3 -> 1.4.4
* utop.2.8.0 -> 2.9.0
* (ocaml 4.13.1 only) lsp.1.9.0 -> 1.10.3
* (ocaml 4.13.1 only) ocaml-lsp-server.1.9.0 -> 1.10.3
* (ocaml 4.13.1 only) jsonrpc.1.9.0 -> 1.10.3

All other package versions have been upgraded using the
ocaml/opam Docker image as of [Feb 28, 2022](https://hub.docker.com/layers/ocaml/opam/windows-msvc-ltsc2022-ocaml-4.12/images/sha256-a96f023f0878154170af6471a0f57d1122f7e90ea3f43c33fef2a16e168e1776).

The switches `diskuv-host-tools` and `host-tools` are no longer in use. Instead
the `dkml` switch provides binaries and environments for `utop` and other core
developer tools.
