## 2.0.2 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### Upgrading?

First uninstall the old Diskuv OCaml version using "Add or remove programs" in the Control Panel.

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv-ocaml.gitlab.io/distributions/dkml/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

For projects using [`setup-dkml` (part of  `dkml-workflows`)](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows)
for their GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:

1. Re-run `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in your project
2. Follow the FOURTH and FIFTH steps of <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#configure-your-project>

### Major Changes

- There are now two installers. The original installer is now called the Native Code Edition. The new installer is the Bytecode Edition.
- If you have used any previous versions, the Program Name seen in Add/Remove Programs has changed from
  `Diskuv OCaml` to `DkML Native`.

### Known Issues

- The uninstaller for 2.0.2 is broken. You'll need to wait for the next release (ie. 2.0.3 or 2.1.0) to get a working uninstaller.

### Bug Fixes

- The global shims now work in a custom installation directory
- The `dkml-runtime-common` package builds on macOS

### Internal Changes

- `with-dkml` does not set MSYS2 or auto-detect the MSVC environment in
  the Bytecode Edition
