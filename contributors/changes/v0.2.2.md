Changes:

* Visual Studio fixes. https://gitlab.com/diskuv/diskuv-ocaml/-/issues/3
  * Detect and require English language pack for Visual Studio.
  * Fix regression introduced in 0.2.x: Auto-installation of Visual Studio has the Windows 10 SDK but not the Visual Studio compiler.
  * Auto-install Visual Studio VC.Tools component for vcpkg use, in addition to VC.14.26 for OCaml use, if the existing installation is not Visual Studio 16.6.
  * Add VC.14.25 as a compatible version so GitHub Actions on a [windows-2019](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments) environment works.
* Many changes to support CI, including adding CI flavor so don't need to install utop, etc. when in CI
* Use new binary dkml-opam-wrapper as Opam wrap-{build|install|remove} command to cache detection of MSVC and lessen need to drop into MSYS2 shell explicitly
* Order of magnitude trimming of fdopen packages to speed up basic Windows opam operations (especially those that involve tarring)
* Pin all at once the fdopen and other packages that are part of the DKML distribution
* Pre-alpha support for macOS. Key features like cross-compiling x86_64 on arm64 to build universal binaries have not been included.
* Pre-alpha support for Windows 32-bit. A couple key packages are not yet ready for 32-bit.

Sharp edges:

* Windows makeit targets and Windows opam commands are significantly slower than Unix. Signficant changes to Opam are necessary to close the performance gap; no quick fix
  is available.
