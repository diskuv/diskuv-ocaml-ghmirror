## 1.2.0 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

Critical changes:
* Switch from the official MSYS2 `msys2-base` install, plus a set of MSYS2
  Internet updates, to a standalone
  [msys2-dkml-base](https://gitlab.com/diskuv-ocaml/distributions/msys2-dkml-base#msys2-dkml-base)
  that has all the MSYS2 packages needed during installation. That removes the
  Internet, GPG keys, proxies, etc. as a source of failures during the MSYS2
  sub-installation.

Performance improvements:
* Plumb the number of cpus to the compiler jobs. [@edwintorok]

Component upgrades:
* Bump stdcompat from `18` to `19`. ocurrent ocaml/opam CI (source of pins)
  updated from 2022-02-28 to 2022-11-22 image; numerous pins updated.
  Closes dkml-installer-ocaml#12
* Bump utop from `2.9.0` to `2.10.0`.

Bug fixes:
* `dkml-runtime-common-native` works with spaces in the Windows home directory
* Removed incorrect `ptime.0.8.6` pin during `dkml init`; now `ptime.1.1.0`

Internal changes:
* Added Jane Street's `base` package to global `utop`. In particular, `base` is
  now part of the `dkml` switch created during installation. *`core` is too
  expensive (52 packages) to install automatically, but you can install utop
  and core in your own switch.*
  > For now this is not that useful. The `lib/stublibs` directory of the `dkml`
  > switch needs to be in the PATH for `#require "base";;` to work in global
  > `utop`. That would help readers of the Real World OCaml book. A future
  > release will automate the PATH change.
* Removed `digestif.1.1.2+msvc` pin since MSVC changes upstreamed to 1.1.3.
* The bytecode `*.bc` embedded in the installer is compiled with 4.14.0
  and its embedded runtime is also 4.14.0.
