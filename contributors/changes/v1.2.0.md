## 1.2.0 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

New features:
* Added Jane Street's `base` package to global `utop`. That will help readers of
  the Real World OCaml book. In particular, `base` is now part of the `dkml`
  switch created during installation. *`core` is too expensive (52 packages)
  to install automatically, but you can install utop and core in your own
  switch.*

Performance improvements:
* Plumb the number of cpus to the compiler jobs. [@edwintorok]

Component upgrades:
* Bump stdcompat from `18` to `19`. ocurrent ocaml/opam CI (source of pins)
  updated from 2022-02-28 to 2022-11-22 image; numerous pins updated.
  Closes dkml-installer-ocaml#12
* Bump utop from `2.9.0` to `2.10.0`.
