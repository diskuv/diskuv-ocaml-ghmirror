## 1.2.0 (2023-01-24)

Callout to **VirtualBox** users: You'll need a workaround for [a not-yet backported FMA fix](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/issues/11487) by doing the following in a PowerShell terminal inside VirtualBox _before_ running the installer:
> ```powershell
> mkdir "$env:ProgramData\DiskuvOCaml\conf\"
> Set-Content -Path "$env:ProgramData\DiskuvOCaml\conf\ocamlcompiler.sexp" -Value "((feature_flag_imprecise_c99_float_ops))"
> ```

Critical changes:
* Switch from the official MSYS2 `msys2-base` install, plus a set of MSYS2
  Internet updates, to a standalone
  [msys2-dkml-base](https://gitlab.com/diskuv-ocaml/distributions/msys2-dkml-base#msys2-dkml-base)
  that has all the MSYS2 packages needed during installation. That removes the
  Internet, GPG keys, proxies, etc. as a source of failures during the MSYS2
  sub-installation.
* Special handling for Scoop package manager on Windows which comingles a
  conflicting bash.exe and git.exe in the same directory. A prior
  `scoop install git` should no longer present a problem during installation.

Performance improvements:
* Plumb the number of cpus to the compiler jobs. [@edwintorok]
* Skip over cross-compiling support when no target ABIs specified.
* Overall shaved ~15 minutes from installation on a 3-CPU machine (80m instead
  of 95m), with additional savings if you have more CPUs.

Component upgrades:
* Bump utop from `2.9.0` to `2.10.0`.
* ocurrent ocaml/opam CI Docker image (a source of pins)
  updated from 2022-02-28 to 2022-11-22; numerous pins updated.

Bug fixes:
* `dkml-runtime-common-native` works with spaces in the Windows home directory
* Removed incorrect `ptime.0.8.6` pin during `dkml init`; now `ptime.1.1.0`

Doc fixes:
* Create `dune-project` in Beyond Basics documentation alongside existing
  `dune init exe` to adhere to Dune 3.x behavior. (Dune 3.6 was added
  in DKML 1.1.0)

Deprecations:
* The `dkml --build-type` build type option will be removed next release. It was
  originally created for Linux builds (perf and AFL variants), and can be
  resurrected and simplified if and when Linux support is added.

Internal changes:
* Added Jane Street's `base` package to global `utop`. In particular, `base` is
  now part of the `dkml` switch created during installation. *`core` is too
  expensive (52 packages) to install automatically, but you can install utop
  and core in your own switch.*
  > For now this is not that useful. The `lib/stublibs` directory of the `dkml`
  > switch needs to be in the PATH for `#require "base";;` to work in global
  > `utop`. That would help readers of the Real World OCaml book. A future
  > release will automate the PATH change.
* Removed `digestif.1.1.2+msvc` pin since MSVC changes upstreamed to 1.1.3.
* The bytecode `*.bc` embedded in the installer is compiled with 4.14.0
  and its embedded runtime is also 4.14.0.
* When using `opam option setenv+=` stop removing the `environment` file to
  force a rebuild of the environment.
* Pin `omd.1.3.1`
* Print timestamp for many logging operations to aid performance comparisons
