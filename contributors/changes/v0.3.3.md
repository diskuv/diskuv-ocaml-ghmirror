## 0.3.3 (2022-01-14)

> The *Diskuv OCaml* distribution is available under the
[diskuv-ocaml Fair Source 0.9 license](https://gitlab.com/diskuv/diskuv-ocaml/-/raw/main/LICENSE.txt).
Other assets available on https://gitlab.com/diskuv/diskuv-ocaml/-/releases may have different licenses;
in particular source code files that prominently display a
[Apache-2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0.txt).

Changes:
* Windows installer would fail when Diskuv zip assets could not be downloaded. Restored behavior
  from earlier versions that would install Cygwin and build the reproducible assets when
  downloads fail.
* Fix regression introduced in 0.3.1 where `opam dkml` would complain of missing PLATFORM
* Mitigate pre- Windows-1909 bug deleting directories when installer cleans a prior installation
