## 2.0.3 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### Upgrading?

First uninstall the old Diskuv OCaml version using "Add or remove programs" in the Control Panel.

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv.com/dkmlbook/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

For projects using [`setup-dkml` (part of  `dkml-workflows`)](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows)
for their GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:

1. Re-run `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in your project
2. Follow the FOURTH and FIFTH steps of <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#configure-your-project>

### Major Changes

  installed. <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-installer-ocaml/issues/60>
