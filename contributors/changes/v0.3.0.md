## 0.3.0 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

[diskuv-ocaml Fair Source 0.9 license](https://gitlab.com/diskuv/diskuv-ocaml/-/raw/main/LICENSE.txt).
Other assets available on https://gitlab.com/diskuv/diskuv-ocaml/-/releases may have different licenses;

Breaking Changes:
* [ocamlformat](https://github.com/ocaml-ppx/ocamlformat#should-i-use-ocamlformat) has been upgraded from
  0.18.0 to 0.19.0. Your code formatting will change, and you will need to change your versioned `.ocamlformat`
  configuration. See Upgrading instructions below for how to change `.ocamlformat`.

Changes:
* There is a new Opam plugin you run with `opam dkml`.  Run it alone to get help. You can use `opam dkml init` to
  initialize/upgrade a `_opam` subdirectory from zero or more `*.opam` files (also known as creating a local Opam
  switch). Other commands may be added which should closely follow the command naming of [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/cli/init)
* There is now a single "system" OCaml compiler rather than the per-switch "base" OCaml compiler of earlier versions.
  That means creating a new `_opam` subdirectory (Opam switch) is significantly quicker.
* The following "CI" packages (available to both CI and Full flavor installations) have been upgraded and are now
  available with the version numbers below:
  `bos.0.2.1`, `cmdliner.1.0.4`, `crunch.3.2.0`, `dune.2.9.1`, `dune-configurator.2.9.1`, `fmt.0.8.10`,
  `ptime.0.8.6-msvcsupport`, `rresult.0.7.0`, `sha.1.15.1`
* The following packages and their dependencies are new to "CI":
  `opam-client.2.1.0`
* The following "Full" packages have been upgraded and are now available with the version numbers below:
  `lsp.1.9.0`, `ocaml-lsp-server.1.9.0`, `jsonrpc.1.9.0`,
  `ocaml-format.0.19.0`, `ocaml-format-rpc.0.19.0`, `ocaml-format-rpc-lib.0.19.0`

Known issues:
* Installing from mainline China frequently errors out. A short term fix is available at
  https://gitlab.com/diskuv/diskuv-ocaml/-/issues/6#note_726814601

### Upgrading from v0.2.0/.../v0.2.6 to v0.3.0

FIRST, to upgrade the system (only necessary on Windows!) run the following in PowerShell:

```powershell
(Test-Path -Path ~\DiskuvOCamlProjects) -or $(ni ~\DiskuvOCamlProjects -ItemType Directory);

iwr `
  "https://gitlab.com/api/v4/projects/diskuv%2Fdiskuv-ocaml/packages/generic/distribution-portable/0.3.0/distribution-portable.zip" `
  -OutFile "$env:TEMP\diskuv-ocaml-distribution.zip";

Expand-Archive `
  -Path "$env:TEMP\diskuv-ocaml-distribution.zip" `
  -DestinationPath ~\DiskuvOCamlProjects `
  -Force;

~\DiskuvOCamlProjects\diskuv-ocaml\installtime\windows\install-world.bat;
```

SECOND, any `.ocamlformat` files in your projects that have:

```
version=0.18.0
```

will need to be changed to:

```
version=0.19.0
```

THIRD, (optional) if you have been exploring the `diskuv-ocaml-starter` project, do the following:

```bash
git pull --ff-only
git submodule update --init
./makeit prepare-dev
```

FOURTH, (optional) in each of your SDK Project directories (both Windows + Linux/macOS), do the following:

```bash
git -C vendor/diskuv-ocaml fetch
git -C vendor/diskuv-ocaml reset --hard v0.3.0
git commit -m "Upgrade diskuv-ocaml to 0.3.0" vendor/diskuv-ocaml
./makeit prepare-dev
```
