## 1.2.1 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### Upgrading?

First uninstall the old Diskuv OCaml version using "Add or remove programs" in the Control Panel.

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv-ocaml.gitlab.io/distributions/dkml/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

### Changes

Bug fixes:

* The installer can now restart after a failed installation, without having
  to use the uninstaller.
* Allow setup to succeed on Windows filesystems that do not support the setting
  of file attributes
