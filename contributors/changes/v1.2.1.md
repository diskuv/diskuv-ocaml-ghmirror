## 1.2.1 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### Upgrading?

First uninstall the old Diskuv OCaml version using "Add or remove programs" in the Control Panel.

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv-ocaml.gitlab.io/distributions/dkml/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

### Changes

Major changes:

* The deprecated `fdopen` repository is no longer used. Previously DkML
  installed a smaller and smaller portion of the `fdopen` repository with each
  subsequent version. Now DkML is relies only on the central opam repository
  and the DkML opam repository.
* Dune upgraded to 3.8.3. Among other things, the installer no longer installs
  a C# file watcher proxy for `dune build -w`; instead Dune uses its own
  native Windows file watcher.
* The set of pinned packages during a `dkml init` local switch has gone down
  from approximately 4000 to 200. Rather than pinning each package in the
  opam universe to a heuristically-determined version, we pin only packages
  that we successfully build on Windows.
* The [`refl`](https://github.com/thierry-martinez/refl#readme) reflection
  package is accessible without installing your own switch

Bug fixes:

* The installer can now restart after a failed installation, without having
  to use the uninstaller.
* Allow setup to succeed on Windows filesystems that do not support the setting
  of file attributes
* FlexDLL object files `flexdll_initer_msvc64.obj` and `flexdll_msvc64.obj` (or
  32-bit variant on 32-bit installs) are installed alongside `flexlink.exe` so
  flexlink can be used by itself without setting `FLEXDIR` environment
  variable.
* The auto-installed `dkml` switch now only has `base`, `refl` and `utop`
  packages. In this and many prior versions other packages had been installed
  as binaries directly to PATH, so other packages in the switch were redundant.
  Makes the compilation install step faster.

* (1) And most of the numerous Jane Street packages
* (2) `conf-pkg-config.2+cpkgs` downloads a native Windows binary `pkgconf` and
  makes it available to opam as `pkg-config`. *Package maintainers*:
  `pkgconf` supports native Windows slightly better than `pkg-config`. It is
  mostly a drop-in replacement, and `dkml init` (the tool to create switches)
  will set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to the location of CLANG64 MSYS2 packages. In a
  future release of DkML after Opam 2.2, CLANG64 MSYS2 packages will be
  installable through depext.

`dkml init` changes:

* The opam switch variable `dkml-abi` is available after running `dkml init`.
  The `dkml-abi` for 64-bit Windows is `windows_x86_64`.
