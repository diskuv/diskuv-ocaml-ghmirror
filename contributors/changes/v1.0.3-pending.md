* The OCaml system compiler installed by the DKML installer will have debug symbols
  turned on so that executables created from OCaml are debuggable using Visual
  Studio Debugger or WinDbg (including Visual Studio Code). All type information
  is stripped by OCaml, and the stack frames don't look exactly like C, so
  debugging requires **advanced** knowledge of OCaml data structures and calling
  conventions. You can create a switch without debug symbols so that your executables
  are much smaller; use `opam dkml init --build-type=Release --non-system-compiler` to
  do that.
