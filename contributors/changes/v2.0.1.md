## 2.0.1 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

### Upgrading?

First uninstall the old Diskuv OCaml version using "Add or remove programs" in the Control Panel.

### What do I do after the install is complete?

You SHOULD read the "Install is done! What next?" at <https://diskuv-ocaml.gitlab.io/distributions/dkml/#install-is-done-what-next> documentation.

If you had any existing local switches, upgrade them by doing `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in the local switch directories.

For projects using [`setup-dkml` (part of  `dkml-workflows`)](https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#dkml-workflows)
for their GitHub Actions / GitLab CI:

1. Re-run `dkml init`, `opam upgrade` and `opam install . --deps-only` in your project
2. Follow the FOURTH and FIFTH steps of <https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-workflows#configure-your-project>

### New Features

- Added `sqlite3` to the global environment (no opam switch needed). The
  [Quick Start](https://gitlab.com/dkml/distributions/dkml#quick-start)
  shows how to use it.

### Bug Fixes

- `$DiskuvOCamlHome/dkmlvars*` now have required newline separating the last line
- opam global vars `msystem-prefix` ... `mingw-package-prefix` were not being set
- Insulate opam commands during installation from any prior `OPAM*` environment vars
- Remove `ocaml-config` from pinning
- All shims are installed; bug with incomplete termination fixed.
- Uninstall code is now present for the global environment
