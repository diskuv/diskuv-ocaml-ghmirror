## 1.0.1 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

* The installer now checks whether files are in use when overwriting a
  previous installation just like the uninstaller already did.
* Fix Dune shim so `dune build` works consistently. https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-installer-ocaml/issues/6
* Fix detection of Jane Street package versions so `ppx_jane` dependencies like `fieldslib`, and other JS packages,
  are pinned to versions like `v0.14.0` (etc.).
