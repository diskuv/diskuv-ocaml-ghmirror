## 1.0.1 (@@YYYYMMDD@@)

* The installer now checks whether files are in use when overwriting a
  previous installation just like the uninstaller already did.
* Fix Dune shim so `dune build` works consistently. https://github.com/diskuv/dkml-installer-ocaml/issues/6
* Fix detection of Jane Street package versions so `ppx_jane` dependencies like `fieldslib`, and other JS packages,
  are pinned to versions like `v0.14.0` (etc.).

### MSYS2 Variables

This release adds the following Opam global variables which are assigned from the corresponding
MSYS2 environment variables:

| Global Variable        | Typical Value            | MSYS2 Environment Variable |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------ | -------------------------- |
| *not set*              | `CLANG64`                | `MSYSTEM`                  |
| `msystem-carch`        | `x86_64`                 | `MSYSTEM_CARCH`            |
| `msystem-chost`        | `x86_64-w64-mingw32`     | `MSYSTEM_CHOST`            |
| `msystem-prefix`       | `/clang64`               | `MSYSTEM_PREFIX`           |
| `mingw-chost`          | `x86_64-w64-mingw32`     | `MINGW_CHOST`              |
| `mingw-prefix`         | `/clang64`               | `MINGW_PREFIX`             |
| `mingw-package-prefix` | `mingw-w64-clang-x86_64` | `MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX`     |

In addition, `with-dkml.exe` and the Opam and Dune shims now automatically set the `MINGW_{CHOST,PREFIX,PACKAGE_PREFIX}`
environment variables that were missing from prior Diskuv OCaml releases.

These variables let you:
* in Bash (`with-dkml bash`) you can use `pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-gcc` to install GCC compiler or
  `pacman -S ${MINGW_PACKAGE_PREFIX}-clang` to install the Clang compiler
* in Opam files (`opam` and `*.opam`) you can use `%{msystem-package-prefix}%`, etc.

*A future release of Diskuv OCaml may automatically install pacman packages using Opam "depext"*
